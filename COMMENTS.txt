Experience:
    The assignment was more cumbursome to do as it didnt 
    have much of a logic and the parsing took a bit time but
    it was fun to do. Debugging was actually a tough part where
    if i had something to change in one of the ads file then i 
    have to go on and reflect that change in every other ads file.
Suggestions for change:
    We could have few modifications in the current program to get as
    practical as possible. Firstly we can have a dynamic creation brought
    into place where we can add multiple tds to the root and populating the 
    server. Here we have fixed the number of domains under a particular ads
    we can change that to a dynamic one and we have to have a check on the 
    portnumbers and this can be replicated.
